# toodoo

A simple to-do list management app built using Next.js and Material UI.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the Firebase config secrets.
Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Note by the developer

This project is meant to be a demonstration of my software development styles and practices. I aim to develop each feature of the tool one-by-one and create releases for both web and mobile platforms.

Please refer to the Projects tab for understanding the roadmap of this project!
